<h3>Version Beta2</h3>
I've got the settings working... partially. Save button works and upon reloading the app it will bring in settings. I've added a non-functional profile to the settings window. Always need something to work forward to in new versions. The About button now displays the full LICENSE file so don't remove it or risk crashing.
<h3>Version Beta1</h3>
This good yet basic pre-release has loading and writing images functional. The settings panel is entirely non-functional UI only and the About button works good but need to display license and if you have agreed to it upon the first run / settings file initial write.
